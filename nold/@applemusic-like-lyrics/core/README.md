AMLL's pure JS core component framework, including lyric display components and background components and other reusable components.

Everything here is UI framework-independent, so it can be indirectly referenced under various dynamic page frameworks.

Or if you need to use component bindings, there's a [React binding version](../react/README.md) and a [Vue binding version](../vue/README.md)

## Usage Summary

For detailed API documentation, please refer to [./docs/modules.md](./docs/modules.md)

A test program can be found in [./src/test.ts](./src/test.ts).

```typescript
import { LyricPlayer } from "@applemusic-like-lyrics/core";
import "@applemusic-like-lyrics/core/style.css"; // Import required styles

const player = new LyricPlayer(); // Create a lyric player component
document.body.appendChild(player.getElement()); // Add the component's element to the page
player.setLyricLines([]) // Set lyrics
player.setCurrentTime(0) // Set current playback time (needs to be called every frame)
player.update(0) // Update lyric component animation (needs to be called every frame)
```

The lyrics set through `LyricPlayer.setLyricLines` is a `LyricLine[]` parameter. For details, please refer to the code in [./src/interfaces.ts](./src/interfaces.ts).
